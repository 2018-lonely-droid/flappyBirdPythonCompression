# Flappy bird python compression expirement

This project is to test various audio and visual compression techniques with the intent of decreasing the size of the flappy bird python game.

# How to use

The `compressions_algorithms.py` script will compress files from the original `/Flappy-bird-python` repository and replace them in the `/Flappy-bird-python-compressed` repository.

After running `compressions_algorithms.py`, you can use `size_check.py` to compare the file size of the original project and the compressed project.
